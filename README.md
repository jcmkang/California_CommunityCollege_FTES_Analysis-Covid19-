# California Community College Student Enrollment Analysis<br>Pre &amp; Post Covid-19 Pandemic

## About
This project is an extension of one of my previous projects completed during my Intro to Data Science class. The objective of this analysis is to examine data of student enrollments from all community colleges in California. The dataset encompasses the enrollment data of Full-Time Equivalent Students (FTES) in all community colleges across California during the academic years spanning from 2016 & 2017 through 2022 & 2023. With the Covid-19 pandemic having subsided and life gradually returning to normal, we have the opportunity to analyze enrollment trends before, during, and after the Covid-19 pandemic. The project will showcase data cleaning techniques using Pandas and employ data visualization using Matplotlib.

## Source
The dataset has been sourced from the [California Community College Chancellorâ€™s Office](https://datamart.cccco.edu/Students/FTES_Summary.aspx). 

## About the Dataset
For the purpose of this analysis, the original dataset has been filtered to include data from the years 2016-2023 and comprises all community colleges in California.

* The dataset encompasses the school years 2016-2017, 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022, and 2022-2023.
* FTES stands for "full-time equivalent students," who are students enrolled for a minimum of 15 hours per week during a given semester.
* Students are categorized into the following three main groups:
1. Transferable - students who take credit classes with the intention of transferring to a University.
2. Vocational - students who take credit and non-credit classes to pursue specific career paths (e.g., nursing, electrician, mechanic).
3. General - students who take credit and non-credit classes for personal interest, excluding transferable and vocational courses.

## Questions to Consider
1. Did the Covid-19 pandemic have a discernible impact on student enrollment in Community Colleges? What does the data indicate about the pre-pandemic enrollment trends over a two-year period, and which colleges experienced the highest enrollment rates?
2. Which type of enrollments were dominant during the years of study?
3. With the limited post-pandemic data available, what conclusions can we draw regarding students' perceptions of education in community colleges? Are students returning back to school?

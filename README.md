# California Community College Student Enrollment Analysis
# Pre &amp; Post Covid-19 Pandemic

## Introduction:
This project is an extension of one of the projects I did in my Intro to Data Science class. This project analyzes the data of student enrollment from all community colleges in California. The dataset categorizes the student enrollments into 3 main categories of transfer, vocational, and general. As the Covid-19 pandemic has subdued and life has restarted, we can start to analyze trends in the enrollment trend pre, during, and post pandemic. The project will display data cleaning using Pandas DataFrame and  display data visualization using Matplotlib.

The dataset is sourced from [California Community College Chancellorâ€™s Office](https://datamart.cccco.edu/Students/FTES_Summary.aspx). 
The preliminary dataset has been filtered to only show the years 2016-2023 and by all the community colleges in California. 

## About the dataset:

* The dataset contains school year 2016 - 2017, 2018 - 2019, 2019 - 2020, 2020 - 2021, 2021-2022, 2022 - 2023. 
* Students are divided into 3 main categories:
1. transferable - students who take credit classes to transfer to a University.
2. vocational - students who take credit and non-credit classes for careers (ie. nursing, electrician, mechanic).
3. general - students who take credit and non-credit classes, for personal interest, not including transferable or vocational.

## Questions to think about:
1. Did Covid - 19 pandemic have an impact on students in Community Colleges? What was the data pre-pandemic spanning for 2 years of which colleges and regions had the most enrollment?

2. What type of enrollments were there mostly? 

3. With the little data we have post pandemic, what are some conclusions we can draw from how students view education in the community college students?

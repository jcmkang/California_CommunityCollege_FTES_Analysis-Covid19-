# California Community College Student Enrollment Trend Pre &amp; Post Covid-19 Pandemic

This project is an extension of one of my projects I did in my Intro to Data Science class. This project analyzes the data of student enrollment from all community colleges in California. The dataset categorizes the student enrollment into 3 main categories of transfer, vocational, and general. As the Covid-19 pandemic has subdued and life has restarted, we can start to analyze trends in the enrollment trend pre, during, and post pandemic. The project will display data cleaning/massaging using Pandas Data Frame and Matplotlib to display data visualization and calculation using Numpy. 

The source of the data is from California Community College Chancellorâ€™s Office. The dataset has been created to filter only the years 2016-2023 as well as by all the community colleges in California. 

About the dataset:

* The dataset contains school year 2016 - 2017, 2018 - 2019, 2019 - 2020, 2020 - 2021, 2021-2022, 2022 - 2023. 
* Students are divided into 3 main categories:
1. transfer students who take credit classes to transfer to a University.
2. vocational students who take credit and non-credit classes for careers (ie. nursing, electrician, mechanic).
3. general students who take credit and non-credit classes, not for transfer or vocational reasons.


Questions to Think about:
1. Did Covid - 19 pandemic have an impact on students in Community Colleges? What was the data pre-pandemic spanning for 2 years of which colleges and regions had the most enrollment?

What type of enrollments were there mostly? 

With the little data we have post pandemic, what are some conclusions we can draw from how students view education in the community college students?
